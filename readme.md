## What it does

Instead of a typical carbon calculator that focuses on personal consumption, this tool evaluates when carbon consciousness reaches critical mass across society. Based on research showing that ~10% population adoption can trigger rapid cultural spread, it analyzes intervention impact across key sectors:

- Architects
- Developers
- Policymakers
- Technologists
- Artists
- Researchers
- Business owners

Users can test different combinations of interventions to identify which strategies have the potential to bring carbon awareness into the cultural zeitgeist.

## Context

Developed as part of the "Carbon Capital" thesis project at Columbia GSAPP, exploring systemic approaches to carbon-negative development in East Harlem. This tool helped evaluate the cultural impact of designed interventions including temples and public installations, ultimately leading to the conceptualization of the Museum of Carbon.
